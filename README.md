## Post Management System
The Post Management System is a web application developed to facilitate the management of posts with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. It leverages the FastAPI framework for backend development, SQLAlchemy for efficient database management, and OAuth2 for secure user authentication. The system ensures robust authorization mechanisms to maintain data integrity and security, allowing only authorized users to modify their respective posts.
 
### Features
